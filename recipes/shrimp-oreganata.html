        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Definitely use very large shrimp for this shrimp oreganata recipe. Think shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. You can serve them as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra lemon-butter sauce, or simply with some grilled bread and flavorful olive oil to dip in.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds colossal shrimp (about 12 shrimp)</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact.</li>
            <li>Use a paring knife to cut lengthwise down vein side of shrimp, cutting almost but not all the way through the shrimp. Remove the vein and gently press shrimp apart to butterfly it.</li>
        </ol>
